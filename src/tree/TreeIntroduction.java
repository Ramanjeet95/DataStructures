 * that are connected together. Each node has some data and pointers or references to child nodes. Child nodes 
 * in turn has other child nodes and so on.
 * 
 * Root- Root is the starting or first node of the tree. It is the ancestor of all the nodes.
 * 
 * Child- Every node except the root node is a child node. Child node is directly referred by one other node
 * which contains a reference to it. The node that contains the reference or points to the child node is called
 * parent node. If we have to go to the child we have to go through the parent.
